## Reddit Deviget

Project Live: [https://reddit-dg.vercel.app](https://reddit-dg.vercel.app)

Some Notes:
- For Read/Unread feature I'm using a `NEW` tag, which dissapears when a post is visited.
- For pagination I'm using a `Load More` button at the end of the Posts List.
- In mobile I have the list in a togglable Menu/Navigation which it's activated in the Menu Icon Button.
- On the detail page I added a Read Full Post which leads to the actual Post on Reddit.
